This violates the 'autonomous' requirement.\n\n**Spec Violation:**\n- orchestrator.md:67-68 specifies 'While WS remaining' loop\n- orchestrator.md:190 allows stopping ONLY for CRITICAL blockers\n- Agent stops after EVERY batch, not just critical blockers\n\n**Impact:**\n- @oneshot is NOT truly autonomous\n- Requires multiple manual interventions (4 sessions for 18 WS)\n- Defeats purpose of autonomous orchestration\n\n**Fix Required:**\nUpdate orchestrator.md or agent implementation to:\n1.

Worktree created successfully: git worktree add ... -b feature/f052-implementation\n2. Location documented: /Users/fall_out_bug/projects/vibe_coding/sdp-f052-impl\n3. Agent executed next @build commands (00-052-01 through 00-052-07) in main dev branch\n4. 7 commits landed in dev instead of feature/f052-implementation\n\nExpected Behavior:\nAgent should:\n1. Detect worktree exists for current feature\n2. Change directory to worktree before executing workstreams\n3. Work in isolation until feature complete\n4. Only then merge back to dev\n\nActual Behavior:\nAgent worked in main dev branch, ignoring worktree setup.\n\nRoot Cause Hypotheses:\n1. @build skill doesn't check for worktree\n2. No context about worktree location passed between sessions\n3. Agent didn't read WS 00-052-00 output (worktree location)\n4. @oneshot orchestrator doesn't handle worktree switching\n\nImpact:\n- Medium: Code landed in dev instead of feature branch\n- Git flow violated, but no data loss\n- Decision made to continue in dev (pragmatic)\n\nInvestigation Tasks:\n- [ ] Review @build skill for worktree detection logic\n- [ ] Review WS 00-052-00 for worktree documentation\n- [ ] Check if worktree info in session context\n- [ ] Design worktree-aware agent behavior\n- [ ] Update skills to respect worktree when present\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Root cause identified\n- Design for worktree-aware agents documented\n- Skills updated to detect and use worktree\n- Test: agent creates worktree and works in it\n\nPriority: P2 (important but not blocking)\nType: Bug (process violation, not code bug)\n\nRelated: F052, WS 00-052-00, gitflow best practices","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"a_v_zhukov@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T12:49:13.031378+03:00","created_by":"Andrei","updated_at":"2026-02-08T20:05:43.073466+03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T20:05:43.073466+03:00","close_reason":"Investigation complete.
