# SDP v2 Vision Documents

This directory contains strategic thinking about SDP's future direction.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) | **Start here.** The SDP v2 vision: trust layer for AI-generated software |
| [2026-02-08-sdp-multi-agent-future-design.md](2026-02-08-sdp-multi-agent-future-design.md) | Technical architecture analysis (10 aspects, 10 experts) |
| [2026-02-08-sdp-honest-assessment-visionaries.md](2026-02-08-sdp-honest-assessment-visionaries.md) | Honest assessment from AI/vibe-coding visionaries (7 experts) |

## Key Decisions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is SDP? | A trust standard for AI-generated software |
| What is it NOT? | A coding framework, project manager, or prompt library |
| Who is it for? | Deeptech/enterprise where code costs more to fix than write |
| UX model? | One command: `sdp ship "description"` — invisible internals |
| Architecture? | Protocol (spec) + Framework (implementation), two repos |
| Integration? | Git hooks + CI (path 1), Agent SDK (path 2) |
| Moat? | Accumulated trust knowledge: verification patterns, decomposition heuristics, cross-model review data |
