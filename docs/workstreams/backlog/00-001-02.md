# 00-001-02: Publish Evidence Schema in sdp Repo

Feature: F001 (sdp_dev-p3y)

## Goal

Publish the evidence envelope JSON Schema in the SDP protocol repo so it can be referenced by any tool.

## Scope Files

- `sdp/schema/` (submodule)
- `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` (this repo)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] JSON Schema file at `sdp/schema/evidence-envelope.schema.json`
- [x] SDP manifest/README references schema for validation
- [x] Validation test: `sdp-evidence validate` (or pr-gate) validates against schema
- [x] Schema version documented (e.g. `evidence-envelope/v1`)

## Out of Scope

- Changing schema format
- Versioning/migration strategy for schema evolution

## Implementation Notes

- Copy or symlink from sdp_lab to sdp submodule; schema lives in protocol repo
- Update `docs/MANIFESTO.md` "What's Coming" — Evidence JSON Schema published

---

## Execution Report

**Completed:** 2026-02-22

**Deliverables:**
- `sdp/schema/evidence-envelope.schema.json` — Copied from `schema/evidence-envelope.schema.json`
- `sdp/README.md` — Added schema reference for validation
- `sdp/docs/MANIFESTO.md` — Updated "What's Coming": Evidence JSON Schema published (Done)
- `docs/MANIFESTO.md` — Updated "What's Coming" table

**Validation:** pr-gate uses `evidence.ValidateStrictFile`; `TestSchemaValidationMatchesEvidenceValidate` proves schema validation matches evidence.Validate behavior.
