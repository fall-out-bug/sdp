# 00-010-01: Delete Dead Orchestration Code (~5.7K LOC)

Feature: F010 (sdp_dev-5ngw)

## Goal

Remove packages and binaries replaced by kubeopencode + beads-bridge. Verify the remaining codebase compiles and tests pass.

## Scope Files (to delete)

- `internal/orchestrator/` — 929 LOC
- `internal/parallel/` — 499 LOC
- `internal/swarm/` — 107 LOC
- `internal/roles/` — 298 LOC
- `internal/agent/` — 885 LOC
- `cmd/swarm-worker/` — 1,573 LOC
- `cmd/swarm-orchestrator/` — 118 LOC
- `cmd/feature-orchestrator/` — 344 LOC
- `cmd/autonomy-worker/` — 596 LOC
- `cmd/intake-gateway/` — 404 LOC

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All listed packages/binaries deleted
- [ ] `go build ./...` succeeds
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes (no broken imports)
- [ ] `go.mod` tidied (unused dependencies removed)
- [ ] Dockerfiles updated (remove deleted binaries)
- [ ] CI workflows updated (remove deleted build targets)
- [ ] Remaining binaries: adapter-controller, sdp-evidence, beads-fsm, beads-bridge
- [ ] LOC reduction verified: ~5,753 LOC removed

## Out of Scope

- Rewriting any remaining code
- Changing adapter-controller behavior

## Implementation Notes

- Do a full `go build ./...` after each batch of deletions to catch cascading import errors
- Some test files may import deleted packages — update or remove
- `go mod tidy` at the end to clean up unused deps
- Check for references in deploy/ manifests, scripts/, docs/
