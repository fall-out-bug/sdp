# 00-057-09: Resolve TODO and rerun F057 quality gates

## Goal

Close remaining technical debt from PR review and produce a clean validation run for F057.

## Context

Review found one untracked TODO in executor dependency parsing and required a full re-run after refactors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Remove/resolve TODO in `internal/executor/executor.go` dependency parsing path
- [ ] AC2: Dependency parsing behavior is explicitly tested
- [ ] AC3: `go test ./... -short` passes in `sdp-plugin/`
- [ ] AC4: `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` pass
- [ ] AC5: All touched files satisfy <=200 LOC gate
- [ ] AC6: PR #17 updated and ready for re-review

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/*.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/*_test.go

**Verification:**
- sdp-plugin/** (full package test/build/vet run)

## Notes

- This is the capstone remediation workstream for F057.
