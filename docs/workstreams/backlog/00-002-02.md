# 00-002-02: Add sdp-evidence inspect Subcommand

Feature: F002 (sdp_dev-y2h)

## Goal

Add `inspect` subcommand that prints a human-readable summary of an evidence envelope.

## Scope Files

- `cmd/sdp-evidence/`
- `internal/evidence/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `sdp-evidence inspect --evidence .sdp/evidence/run-123.json` prints human-readable summary
- [x] Summary includes: intent, plan summary, execution (files changed), verification status, review status, boundary compliance, provenance chain status
- [x] Exit 0 if valid, non-zero if invalid (same as validate)
- [x] Output suitable for CI logs or terminal

## Out of Scope

- JSON output mode (optional later)
- Interactive mode

## Implementation Notes

- Use `internal/evidence` types to parse and format
- Keep output concise: one line per section or a small table
