# 00-002-03: Goreleaser + GitHub Actions for sdp-evidence Releases

Feature: F002 (sdp_dev-1gh)

## Goal

Automate binary releases for `sdp-evidence` via Goreleaser and GitHub Actions.

## Scope Files

- `.goreleaser.yml` (or `cmd/sdp-evidence/.goreleaser.yml`)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (or similar)
- `README.md` — install instructions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Goreleaser config builds `sdp-evidence` for linux/amd64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64
- [x] GitHub Action triggers on tag push (e.g. `v0.1.0`)
- [x] Release artifacts: binary, checksums, optionally GPG signature
- [x] Install instructions: `curl | sh` or `go install` from repo
- [ ] At least one test release created (unverified)

## Out of Scope

- Homebrew tap (later)
- Docker image (later)

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse patterns from sdp-plugin if it has goreleaser
- Binary name: `sdp-evidence` or `sdp-evidence` (user preference)
- Repo: sdp_dev or future traceforge repo
