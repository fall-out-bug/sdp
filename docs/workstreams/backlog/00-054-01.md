# 00-054-01: Schema Consolidation

## Goal

Consolidate schema sprawl from 2 locations into 1 canonical registry. Foundation for the evidence schema.

## Context

Currently schemas live in:
- `schema/` — workstream.schema.json, status.schema.json, index.json
- `docs/schema/` — traceability.json, intent.schema.json

This creates confusion about which is canonical and makes adding new schemas risky.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: All schemas in `schema/` directory (single location)
- [ ] AC2: `docs/schema/` removed (or symlinked)
- [ ] AC3: `schema/index.json` updated to reference all schemas
- [ ] AC4: Existing imports/references updated (no broken paths)
- [ ] AC5: Tests pass — any code loading schemas still works

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- schema/index.json
- schema/traceability.schema.json (moved from docs/schema/traceability.json)
- schema/intent.schema.json (moved from docs/schema/intent.schema.json)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/parser/workstream_test.go (verify schema loading)

## Verification

```bash
# All schemas in one place
ls schema/*.json | wc -l  # Should be 5+
# Old location gone
test ! -d docs/schema || echo "FAIL: docs/schema still exists"
# Tests pass
cd sdp-plugin && go test ./internal/parser/... -v
```

## Notes

- ~1h work — mostly file moves and reference updates
- Foundation: WS-03 (evidence schema) depends on this
