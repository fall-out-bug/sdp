## Goal

Provide clear, non-blocking collaboration signals when parallel workstreams overlap in scope.

## Context

Collision detection exists as roadmap intent; team UX needs actionable signal format and flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define collision severity levels and message templates
- [ ] AC2: Surface collisions in status output and summary artifacts
- [ ] AC3: Suggest coordination actions (owner handoff, contract sync, rebase)
- [ ] AC4: Track acknowledged vs unresolved collisions
- [ ] AC5: Add tests for collision signal generation

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/guard/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/status/
  - docs/reference/team-workflow.md
  - docs/reference/commands.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Collision alerts are visible before merge conflict stage
- [ ] Suggested remediation is attached to each alert
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
