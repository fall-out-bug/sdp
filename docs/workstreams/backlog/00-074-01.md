## Goal

Define contractual boundaries for `L0-L2` and profile-based installation model.

## Context

Layered public adoption requires explicit contracts; otherwise packaging and onboarding drift over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define profile schema (`protocol`, `safety`, `core`)
- [ ] AC2: Define what each profile includes/excludes
- [ ] AC3: Define dependency constraints across levels (`L0` -> `L1` -> `L2`)
- [ ] AC4: Define compatibility policy for profile upgrades
- [ ] AC5: Publish profile contract doc with examples

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/vision/LAYERED-ADOPTION.md
  - docs/PROTOCOL.md
  - docs/reference/configuration.md
  - docs/workstreams/backlog/F074-WORKSTREAMS-SUMMARY.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Layer contracts are explicit and versioned
- [ ] Profile schema is referenced by downstream WS
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
