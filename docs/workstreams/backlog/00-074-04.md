- [ ] AC2: Define brew install/upgrade flow from L1 to L2
- [ ] AC3: Validate core orchestrator workflows in packaged mode
- [ ] AC4: Add regression checks for profile transitions (`L1 -> L2`)
- [ ] AC5: Confirm MIT boundary and artifact integrity for L2

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/
  - scripts/
  - .github/workflows/
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/installation.md
```

## Definition of Done
