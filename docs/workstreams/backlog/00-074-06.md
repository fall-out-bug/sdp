## Goal

Publish final adoption playbook for progressive public stack rollout and release readiness.

## Context

Layering only works if users can choose entry level and upgrade path clearly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Publish level-by-level adoption guide (`L0` to `L2`)
- [ ] AC2: Publish migration matrix across profiles (`protocol`, `safety`, `core`)
- [ ] AC3: Add release gates per level (quality + packaging)
- [ ] AC4: Update README and reference docs with canonical adoption path
- [ ] AC5: Publish F074 completion report and open follow-up issues

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - README.md
  - PRODUCT_VISION.md
  - docs/vision/ROADMAP.md
  - docs/vision/LAYERED-ADOPTION.md
  - docs/reference/installation.md
```

## Definition of Done
