## Goal

Remove all binary executables from git history and prevent future commits.

## Context

Found ~80MB of binaries in repo:
- `./sdp` (19.7 MB)
- `./sdp-plugin/bin/sdp` (12.9 MB)
- `sdp-darwin-amd64`, `sdp-darwin-arm64` (~18 MB)
- `sdp-linux`, `sdp-linux-amd64` (~18 MB)
- `sdp-windows-amd64.exe`, `sdp.exe` (~19 MB)

These should be:
1. Built by CI on release
2. Distributed via GitHub Releases
3. NEVER committed to git

## Scope

- [ ] Add `bin/` and binary patterns to .gitignore
- [ ] Remove tracked binaries from git
- [ ] Verify CI builds binaries on release
- [ ] Update documentation to use `go install` or release downloads

## Files to Remove

```
./sdp
./sdp-plugin/bin/sdp
./sdp-plugin/bin/sdp-darwin-*
./sdp-plugin/bin/sdp-linux*
./sdp-plugin/bin/sdp*.exe
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: All binaries removed from git tracking
- [ ] AC2: .gitignore updated with binary patterns
- [ ] AC3: CI still builds and releases binaries
- [ ] AC4: Documentation updated with install instructions
