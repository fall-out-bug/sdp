## Goal

Establish a deterministic baseline of repository health for agents, CI, release, and repository hygiene to anchor all F067 improvements.

## Context

F067 is a hardening feature. Without a frozen baseline, follow-up workstreams risk optimizing the wrong bottlenecks or moving targets.

This workstream creates the authoritative "before" snapshot used by subsequent WS validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Record current toolchain matrix (root go.mod, plugin go.mod, CI go-version, Docker image version)
- [ ] AC2: Record CI stability baseline for key workflows (Go CI, verify workflows)
- [ ] AC3: Record baseline for quality drifts (coverage threshold mismatch, guard enforcement mismatch)
- [ ] AC4: Record baseline for prompt/agent duplication and drift points
- [ ] AC5: Record repository hygiene baseline (tracked binaries, tracked runtime logs/evidence files)
- [ ] AC6: Save baseline report in docs/reference with timestamped filename
- [ ] AC7: Include explicit target metrics for each follow-up WS

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/reference/2026-02-13-f067-baseline-reality-snapshot.md  # NEW
  - docs/drafts/idea-F067-repo-hardening-alignment.md            # UPDATE targets if needed
  - docs/workstreams/backlog/F067-WORKSTREAMS-SUMMARY.md         # UPDATE metrics references if needed
```

## Implementation Notes

### Baseline Inputs

Collect from:
- `go.mod` and `sdp-plugin/go.mod`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `sdp-plugin/Dockerfile`
- `prompts/*`, `.cursor/*`, `.opencode/*`
- git-tracked large/generated artifacts

### Metrics Schema

Use structured sections:
1. Toolchain
2. CI reliability
3. Quality gate consistency
4. Agent/adapter path consistency
5. Distribution contract consistency
6. Repository hygiene

### Output Requirements

The report MUST include:
- Measurable baseline values
- Target values tied to specific WS IDs
- Clear "out of scope for F067" section to avoid expansion

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Baseline report created and reviewed for completeness
- [ ] All AC met
- [ ] Metrics are quantitative (no "good/bad" only)
- [ ] Downstream WS can reference report without re-auditing
