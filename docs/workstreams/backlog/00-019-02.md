# 00-019-02: Compress Planning & Design Skills

Feature: F019 (sdp_dev-hbum)

## Goal

Compress 4 planning skills + merge 2 pairs. Strip "Next Steps" from all.

## Scope Files

### Compress

| Skill | Before | Target | Key Change |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| `sdp/prompts/skills/think/SKILL.md` | 244 | ~80 | Cut expert table (LLMs know experts), cut Stage 3 template |
| `sdp/prompts/skills/reality-check/SKILL.md` | 253 | ~60 | Cut examples/anti-patterns |
| `.opencode/skills/verify-workstream/SKILL.md` | 239 | ~80 | Cut verbose examples |
| `sdp/prompts/skills/design/SKILL.md` | 160 | ~100 | Remove phantom commands, "Next Steps" |

### Merge

| Source | Into | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `sdp/prompts/skills/discovery/SKILL.md` | `sdp/prompts/skills/feature/SKILL.md` Step 0 | Only roadmap overlap check (~20 lines) is useful |
| `.opencode/skills/prd/SKILL.md` | `.opencode/skills/vision/SKILL.md` | Two PRD formats → one |

### Strip "Next Steps" From

- idea, design, feature, deploy (all planning/design skills that end with handoff lists)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] @think ≤80 lines, no expert table
- [x] @reality-check ≤60 lines
- [x] @verify-workstream ≤80 lines
- [x] @design ≤100 lines, zero phantom CLI commands
- [x] @discovery deleted, useful content in @feature Step 0
- [x] @prd deleted, functionality in @vision
- [x] Zero "Next Steps" or "Next step:" sections in any planning skill
- [x] @idea, @feature, @deploy end with output description, not delegation list

## Out of Scope

- @reality (160 lines, already clean — no changes)
- @ux (111 lines, already clean — no changes)
