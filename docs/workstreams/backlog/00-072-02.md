## Goal

Implement import pipeline for selected external ecosystems into SDP workstream protocol.

## Context

Adoption improves when teams can migrate existing specs/tasks instead of rebuilding from scratch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Build parser adapters for selected targets (OpenSpec, Taskmaster, CCPM)
- [ ] AC2: Map imported artifacts to SDP feature/workstream structure
- [ ] AC3: Emit migration warnings for lossy transformations
- [ ] AC4: Add fixtures and contract tests per source format
- [ ] AC5: Add CLI entrypoint for import dry-run and apply mode

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/importer/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/schema/
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/interop-matrix.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Import path supports dry-run and validated write mode
- [ ] Each adapter has representative fixture coverage
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
