# 00-012-01: awesome-opencode Submission + Blog Post

Feature: F012 (sdp_dev-yall)

## Goal

Get SDP listed in awesome-opencode. Write a blog post or detailed README section explaining evidence for autonomous agent swarms.

## Scope Files

- External: awesome-opencode repo (PR)
- `sdp/README.md` — may need polish for submission

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PR submitted to awesome-opencode with SDP protocol + sdp-evidence CLI
- [ ] Description focuses on evidence layer (not orchestration)
- [ ] Blog post or extended README section: "Evidence for Autonomous Agent Swarms"
- [ ] Post explains: what evidence is, why it matters, how to use sdp-evidence validate
- [ ] Listed in awesome-opencode (or PR in review)

## Out of Scope

- Marketing or social media
- Conference talks

## Implementation Notes

- awesome-opencode has categories; SDP fits under "Quality" or "Observability"
- Blog post can be a GitHub gist, dev.to post, or docs/blog/ in sdp repo
- Include concrete example: before (agent PR with no proof) vs after (PR with evidence envelope)
