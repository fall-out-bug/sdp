# 00-013-02: Run 10 Consecutive, Fix Failures

Feature: F013 (sdp_dev-7ms2)

## Goal

Run the E2E test harness 10 times. Fix whatever breaks. Achieve 10/10 consecutive successful runs.

## Scope Files

- Any file that causes failures (discovered during runs)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 10 consecutive E2E runs succeed
- [ ] Each run produces a valid evidence envelope with complete hash chain
- [ ] Each run produces a merged PR
- [ ] Budget stayed within limits across all runs
- [ ] No manual intervention required for any run
- [ ] All fixes committed and tested

## Out of Scope

- Performance optimization
- Multi-cluster support

## Implementation Notes

- This is the "fix what breaks" workstream — scope is unknown until we run the tests
- Expected failure categories: handoff artifact format issues, evidence section missing, model failures, timeout, workspace conflicts
- Track each failure as a sub-issue if complex
- Size XL because the scope is unbounded — we fix until it works
