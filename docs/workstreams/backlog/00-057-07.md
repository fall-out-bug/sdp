# 00-057-07: Refactor log command handlers to <=200 LOC per file

## Goal

Split `cmd/sdp/log.go` into focused files (`log_show`, `log_export`, `log_stats`, `log_trace`) so each file is <=200 LOC.

## Context

Review for PR #17 flagged `cmd/sdp/log.go` (296 LOC) as a quality-gate violation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `cmd/sdp/log.go` reduced to <=200 LOC
- [ ] AC2: Extracted command handler files are each <=200 LOC
- [ ] AC3: CLI behavior remains identical for `sdp log` subcommands
- [ ] AC4: `go test ./cmd/sdp/...` passes

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/log.go (refactor/split)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/log_*.go (new files as needed)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/integration_test.go (update only if needed)

## Notes

- Keep flags and help text unchanged.
- Preserve existing output format compatibility.
