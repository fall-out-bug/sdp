# WS: Model Routing System

**Feature**: F079 - Model Routing & Economics
**ID**: 00-079-01
**Priority**: P0
**Depends on**: -

## Goal
Add intelligent model routing based on task type and complexity.

## Scope Files
- `src/sdp/model/router.go` (NEW)
- `src/sdp/model/router_test.go` (NEW)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Route tasks to appropriate models based on type
2. Support complexity-based model selection
3. Configurable model profiles (fast/quality/balanced)
4. Default routing rules for common task types
5. Custom routing rules support
6. Tests for routing logic (>= 80% coverage)

## Out of Scope
- Cooldowns (00-079-02)
- Fallback chain (00-079-03)

## Implementation Notes
```go
type ModelProfile struct {
    Name       string
    ModelID    string
    Speed      string  // "fast", "balanced", "quality"
    MaxTokens  int
    CostPer1K  float64
}

type Router struct {
    profiles map[string]ModelProfile
    rules    []RoutingRule
}

func (r *Router) SelectModel(taskType string, complexity int) ModelProfile
```

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for each routing rule
- Test complexity thresholds
- Verify profile selection
