# 00-057-08: Split cmd integration tests to <=200 LOC per file

## Goal

Refactor oversized CLI integration tests into multiple focused test files, each <=200 LOC.

## Context

Review for PR #17 flagged `cmd/sdp/integration_test.go` (1204 LOC) as a quality-gate violation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `cmd/sdp/integration_test.go` reduced to <=200 LOC
- [ ] AC2: New `*_test.go` files are each <=200 LOC
- [ ] AC3: Existing scenarios are preserved (plan/apply/log/help/e2e)
- [ ] AC4: `go test ./cmd/sdp/...` passes

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/integration_test.go (refactor/split)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/*_integration_test.go (new files as needed)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/*_integration_test.go

## Notes

- Keep test names stable where practical for CI history continuity.
- No production code changes expected.
