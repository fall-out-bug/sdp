## Goal

Package and distribute `L1` safety/evidence bundle via Homebrew under MIT.

## Context

Teams need guardrails (hooks/guard/traces/provenance) without adopting full orchestrator stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define L1 binary/profile packaging surface
- [ ] AC2: Define brew formula/install contract for L1 profile
- [ ] AC3: Ensure L1 includes required safety commands and docs
- [ ] AC4: Add installation verification and smoke checks for L1
- [ ] AC5: Confirm MIT boundary and artifact integrity for L1

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - scripts/install.sh
  - .github/workflows/
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/
  - docs/reference/installation.md
  - README.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] L1 can be installed and verified independently
- [ ] Safety bundle behavior is documented and tested
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
