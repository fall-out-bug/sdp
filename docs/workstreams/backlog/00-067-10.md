## Goal

Resolve the dual Go module tree confusion by introducing `go.work` and documenting the canonical module structure.

## Context

Go source code lives in two separate module trees:

| Tree | Module | Files | Purpose |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `sdp-plugin/` | `github.com/fall-out-bug/sdp` | 324 internal files | CLI + main logic |
| `src/sdp/` | (root `go.mod`) | ~50 files | Graph, synthesis, monitoring, agents |

These two modules don't reference each other. Tests in `tests/` cover `src/sdp/` but not `sdp-plugin/internal/`. There's no `go.work` to manage them as a workspace.

Contributors don't know where to add code. Build commands differ between trees.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Create `go.work` at repo root tying both modules together
- [ ] AC2: Document which module is for what in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] AC3: Verify `go work sync` succeeds without errors
- [ ] AC4: Both modules build from repo root via workspace
- [ ] AC5: Tests for both modules can be run from a single command
- [ ] AC6: Evaluate feasibility of merging `src/sdp/` into `sdp-plugin/internal/` (document decision)
- [ ] AC7: CI updated to use workspace-aware build if needed

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - go.work                          # NEW
  - go.mod                           # root module
  - sdp-plugin/go.mod               # plugin module
  - CONTRIBUTING.md                  # document module structure
  - .github/workflows/go-ci.yml     # workspace-aware build
```

## Implementation Notes

### go.work File

```go
go 1.24

use (
    .
    ./sdp-plugin
)
```

### Module Relationship Analysis

Before creating go.work, analyze:
1. Does `sdp-plugin` import from root module? (likely no)
2. Does root module import from `sdp-plugin`? (likely no)
3. Are there shared types or interfaces? (check for duplicated types)

### Long-term Strategy

Decision to document in AC6:
- **Option A**: Keep two modules with go.work (less churn, more complexity)
- **Option B**: Merge `src/sdp/` into `sdp-plugin/internal/` (one module, clean but big diff)
- **Option C**: Deprecate root module, make `sdp-plugin/` the only module

### Unified Test Command

```bash
# From repo root with go.work:
go test ./...                    # tests both modules
go test ./sdp-plugin/...        # just plugin
go test ./src/sdp/...           # just core
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] go.work exists and `go work sync` succeeds
- [ ] Module architecture documented
- [ ] Consolidation strategy documented as ADR
- [ ] AC1-AC7 met
