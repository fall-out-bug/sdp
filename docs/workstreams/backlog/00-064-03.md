## Goal

Implement Go integration with beads CLI for issue creation and linking.

## Context

When beads is enabled, tasks should be mirrored to beads for team tracking.

Need to:
1. Detect beads availability
2. Create beads issues
3. Maintain bidirectional links

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Detect beads: `bd --version` + `.beads/` directory check
- [ ] AC2: Create beads issue via `bd create` command
- [ ] AC3: Extract beads ID from output
- [ ] AC4: Update workstream frontmatter with beads_id
- [ ] AC5: Update beads notes with workstream path
- [ ] AC6: Graceful fallback when beads unavailable

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/resolver/beads.go
  - sdp-plugin/internal/task/beads.go
```

## Notes

- Use exec.Command to call beads CLI
- Parse JSON output from `bd show --json`
- Don't require beads - just enhance when available
