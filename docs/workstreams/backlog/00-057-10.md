# 00-057-10: CI: Raise test coverage to meet 65% threshold

## Goal

Bring total test coverage in `sdp-plugin` to at least 65% so the Go CI "Check coverage threshold" step passes (PR #17).

## Context

Current coverage is 63.1%; CI requires 65%. Build and Test job fails at the coverage step.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total` reports >= 65%
- [ ] AC2: `.github/workflows/go-ci.yml` coverage step passes without change to threshold, or threshold is documented and adjusted with rationale
- [ ] AC3: `go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...` passes in `sdp-plugin/`

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/**/*_test.go (add or extend tests in low-coverage packages)

**Verification:**
- .github/workflows/go-ci.yml
- sdp-plugin/ (full test run with coverage)

## Notes

- Prefer raising coverage over lowering threshold; if threshold is changed, document in workflow or ADR.
