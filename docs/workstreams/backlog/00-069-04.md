## Goal

Improve interactive mode so users can accept/refine/reject next-step recommendations without losing context.

## Context

Drive mode should feel like controlled progress, not repeated re-orientation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Add accept/refine/reject loop for recommended actions
- [ ] AC2: Preserve prior answers and inferred context between steps
- [ ] AC3: Provide clear "why recommended" text for each step
- [ ] AC4: Add safe exit and resume points in interactive loop
- [ ] AC5: Add tests for interrupted and resumed sessions

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/orchestrator/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/checkpoint/
  - docs/reference/commands.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Interactive loop supports predictable multi-step progression
- [ ] Resume path restores context and next recommendation
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
