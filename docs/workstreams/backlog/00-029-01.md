# 00-029-01: Workstream Index Reset — Archive F001-F013, Add F028-F052

Feature: F029 (sdp_dev-w69o)
Phase: 7 (Dogfood Bootstrap)
Status: Done

## Goal

Reset the workstream INDEX.md to reflect the new standards-based roadmap. Archive pre-pivot workstreams (F001-F013 which targeted K8s infrastructure) and add the new Phase 7-12 features.

## Scope Files

- `docs/workstreams/INDEX.md`
- `docs/workstreams/backlog/00-028-01.md` (new)
- `docs/workstreams/backlog/00-029-01.md` (new)
- `docs/workstreams/backlog/00-030-01.md` (new)
- `.beads-sdp-mapping.jsonl`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] F001-F013 workstreams marked "Archived (pre-pivot)" in INDEX.md
- [x] New Phase 7 features (F028-F030) added to INDEX.md with workstream files
- [x] New Phase 8-12 features (F031-F052) listed in INDEX.md as backlog features
- [x] Beads issues created for F028-F030
- [x] `.beads-sdp-mapping.jsonl` updated for new workstreams
- [x] `wc -l .beads-sdp-mapping.jsonl` == `ls docs/workstreams/backlog/*.md | wc -l`
