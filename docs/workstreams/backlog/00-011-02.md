# 00-011-02: kubeopencode UP-003 Evidence Hooks Proposal

Feature: F011 (sdp_dev-lb2p)

## Goal

Propose and implement evidence hooks in kubeopencode so any user can project evidence from Task completion events.

## Scope Files

- External: kubeopencode repo
- `docs/drafts/` — proposal document

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design proposal written and submitted as kubeopencode issue/discussion
- [ ] Hook points defined: pre-dispatch, post-complete, pre-cleanup
- [ ] Hook interface: webhook URL or sidecar container pattern
- [ ] If accepted: implementation PR submitted
- [ ] SDP adapter-controller can use these hooks instead of custom reconciler logic

## Out of Scope

- SDP-specific evidence logic (that stays in SDP)
- Retry budget (00-011-01)

## Implementation Notes

- The pattern: kubeopencode calls a webhook when Task transitions to terminal phase
- Webhook payload includes Task status, agent output, timing
- SDP's adapter-controller registers as a webhook receiver
- This makes SDP's evidence bridge reusable by anyone, not just us
