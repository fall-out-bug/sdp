## Goal

Implement a guided setup flow that takes a new user from install to first runnable workstream.

## Context

Current setup is documented but not guided; new users must infer order and required prerequisites.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Add guided initialization mode with explicit step progression
- [ ] AC2: Detect missing prerequisites and provide fix commands inline
- [ ] AC3: Generate minimal ready-to-run project scaffold (or validate existing one)
- [ ] AC4: End flow with "next command" output and validation status
- [ ] AC5: Add regression tests for first-run success and prerequisite failures

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - sdp-plugin/internal/doctor/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - README.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Guided mode is reachable from CLI help and onboarding docs
- [ ] First-run happy path succeeds on clean environment
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
