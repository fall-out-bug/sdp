## Goal

Define team operating model for human and agent collaboration in SDP workflows.

## Context

Single-user UX improvements do not automatically scale to multi-developer environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define role taxonomy (owner, implementer, reviewer, operator)
- [ ] AC2: Define ownership rules per workstream state
- [ ] AC3: Define handoff responsibilities and approval expectations
- [ ] AC4: Map role model to current command flow and beads usage
- [ ] AC5: Publish team operating model document

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/reference/team-workflow.md  # NEW
  - docs/PROTOCOL.md
  - AGENTS.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Team roles are explicit and non-overlapping for core flows
- [ ] Operating model is referenced by collaboration workstreams
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
