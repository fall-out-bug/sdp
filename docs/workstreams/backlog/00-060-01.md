# 00-060-01: Cross-Feature Boundary Detection

## Goal

Extend scope collision detection (F054) to identify shared boundaries across parallel features — not just file overlaps, but interface surfaces that need coordination.

## Context

F054 detects "Feature A and Feature B both touch `user_model.go`." This WS goes deeper: "Feature A needs User.email + User.name, Feature B needs User.email + User.role — they need to agree on the User interface."

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `sdp collision detect --deep` analyzes not just file overlap but interface overlap
- [ ] AC2: Parse Go interfaces/structs from scope files to identify shared types
- [ ] AC3: Report: shared types, fields needed by each feature, merge recommendation
- [ ] AC4: Works with Go code (initial target — extend to other languages later)
- [ ] AC5: Output: human-readable + `--output=json`

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/collision/boundary.go (new)
- sdp-plugin/internal/collision/boundary_test.go (new)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/collision.go (update — add --deep flag)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/collision/boundary_test.go

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Uses Go AST parsing (go/parser, go/ast) to extract interfaces/structs
- This is the P1 step: P0 collision → **P1 boundary detection** → P1 contracts → P2 cross-branch
- Start with structs/interfaces — function signatures as stretch goal
