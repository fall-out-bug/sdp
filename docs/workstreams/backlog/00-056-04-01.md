# 00-056-04: Full Pipeline Evidence Verification

## Goal

### 🎯 Goal

End-to-end test: complete feature lifecycle emits unbroken evidence chain from `@idea` through `@deploy`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: E2E test: idea → design → build → review → deploy produces complete chain
- [x] AC2: `sdp log trace` shows events from every skill type in correct order
- [x] AC3: `sdp log show --type=X` works for all 4 event types
- [x] AC4: Chain integrity: no gaps between plan → generation → verification → approval
- [x] AC5: Documentation updated: evidence coverage matrix (skill → event types)

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go (update — full pipeline test)
- docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md (new — skill × event matrix)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- Capstone for F056 — proves all instrumentation works together

### Execution Report

- **Completed:** 2026-02-10
- **Artifacts:** integration_test.go TestFullPipelineEvidenceChain (5-event chain, Verify, FilterByType for plan/generation/verification/approval); docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md (skill × event matrix, commands).
- **Verification:** go test ./internal/evidence -run TestFullPipelineEvidenceChain pass.
- **Post-build:** Go build and test in sdp-plugin.
