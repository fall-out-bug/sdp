## Goal

Reduce documentation bloat by archiving old workstreams and consolidating redundant docs.

## Context

Current state:
- 654 total .md files in repo
- 200 completed workstreams (cluttering docs/workstreams/completed)
- 135 backlog workstreams (some may be stale)
- Multiple overlapping docs (vision, reference, drafts)
- Old ADRs that may be superseded

This makes it hard for AI agents to find relevant context and slows down searches.

## Strategy

1. Archive completed workstreams older than 6 months to docs/archive/
2. Review backlog workstreams - close stale ones
3. Consolidate overlapping documentation
4. Add .gitarchive for historical reference

## Scope

### Archive
- [ ] Move completed WS > 6 months old to docs/archive/workstreams/
- [ ] Create index file for archived WS

### Cleanup
- [ ] Review 135 backlog WS - identify stale/obsolete
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate docs in docs/vision/
- [ ] Clean up docs/drafts/ (old @idea outputs)

### Structure
- [ ] Create docs/README.md with navigation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with doc structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Completed workstreams archived (200 → ~50 active)
- [ ] AC2: Stale backlog workstreams closed or removed
- [ ] AC3: Total .md files reduced by 40%+ (654 → ~400)
- [ ] AC4: docs/README.md created with clear navigation
