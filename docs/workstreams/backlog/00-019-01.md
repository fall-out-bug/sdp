# 00-019-01: Compress Operational Skills

Feature: F019 (sdp_dev-b5hl)

## Goal

Compress 8 operational skills to the @debug/@ci-triage standard (50-100 lines). Remove bloat, keep essentials.

## Scope Files

| Skill | Before | Target | Key Change |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| `.opencode/skills/bugfix/SKILL.md` | ~200 | ~60 | Strip to: classify → branch → fix → test → PR |
| `.opencode/skills/hotfix/SKILL.md` | ~200 | ~60 | Strip to: branch from master → fix → test → PR |
| `.opencode/skills/issue/SKILL.md` | ~200 | ~30 | Keep classification table + routing only |
| `.opencode/skills/guard/SKILL.md` | 185 | ~40 | Keep 4 real commands only |
| `.opencode/skills/beads/SKILL.md` | 346 | ~80 | Keep Quick Reference + integration points |
| `.opencode/skills/prototype/SKILL.md` | 100 | ~30 | Keep gate override table only |
| `.opencode/skills/tdd/SKILL.md` | ~150 | ~50 | Rewrite example for Go, keep Red/Green/Refactor |
| `.opencode/skills/protocol-consistency/SKILL.md` | 76 | ~60 | Minor: remove phantom commands |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each skill ≤100 lines
- [x] No "NEVER/MUST/ALWAYS" behavioral rule walls (max 2 per skill)
- [x] No "Next Steps" sections
- [x] All commands are real (verified in codebase)
- [x] @debug (106 lines) and @ci-triage (77 lines) remain untouched as reference standard
- [x] Skills still referenced correctly by @build, @review, @oneshot
