## WS-00-050-14: Command Auto-Retry

### 🎯 Goal

Retry failed commands with exponential backoff. Detect failure (exit != 0), retry (1s → 2s → 4s), max 3 retries, log to telemetry.

**Problem (from 827 sessions):**
> 4,904 Bash command failures (13% rate) cause friction

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: Detect command failure (exit != 0)
- [ ] AC2: Retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] AC3: Max 3 retries before escalation
- [ ] AC4: Log retry attempts to telemetry
- [ ] AC5: Integration with TDD runner
- [ ] AC6: Integration with orchestrator
- [ ] Coverage ≥ 80%

**Dependencies:** 00-050-02

**Builds on F041:**
- 🆕 Add `internal/retry/` package
