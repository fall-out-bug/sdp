# 00-057-06: Refactor executor package to <=200 LOC per file

## Goal

Split oversized executor files so every source and test file in `internal/executor/` is <=200 LOC while keeping execution semantics unchanged.

## Context

Review for PR #17 flagged `internal/executor/executor.go` (451 LOC) and `internal/executor/executor_test.go` (669 LOC) as quality-gate violations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `internal/executor/executor.go` is split into files <=200 LOC each
- [ ] AC2: `internal/executor/executor_test.go` is split into files <=200 LOC each
- [ ] AC3: Retry, dependency ordering, and dry-run behavior are unchanged
- [ ] AC4: `go test ./internal/executor/...` passes
- [ ] AC5: Coverage remains >=80%

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/executor.go (refactor/split)
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/*.go (new files as needed)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/executor_test.go (refactor/split)
- sdp-plugin/internal/executor/*_test.go (new files as needed)

## Notes

- Keep `ProgressRenderer` API stable.
- No behavior or output schema changes.
