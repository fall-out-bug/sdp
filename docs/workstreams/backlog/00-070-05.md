## Goal

Operationalize recovery UX with clear runbooks, training path, and release gate.

## Context

Recovery features degrade quickly without formalized operational ownership and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Publish recovery runbook covering top failure classes
- [x] AC2: Add recovery drill checklist for maintainers
- [x] AC3: Define MTTR target and measurement method
- [ ] AC4: Add release gate requiring recovery KPIs to pass (deferred to F073)
- [x] AC5: Produce F070 closure report with unresolved risks

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/reference/runbooks.md
  - docs/reference/errors.md
  - docs/workstreams/backlog/F070-WORKSTREAMS-SUMMARY.md
```

## Implementation Summary

Created comprehensive documentation:
- docs/reference/runbooks.md - Complete runbook with recovery procedures
- docs/reference/errors.md - Error code reference with all 38 codes

Runbook includes:
- Quick reference table for all error classes
- Detailed recovery procedures for common errors
- Diagnostics tools section
- Recovery drill checklist for maintainers
- MTTR target: < 5 minutes

## Definition of Done

- [x] Recovery process can be executed by new operator using docs only
- [x] MTTR target defined (< 5 minutes for classified errors)
- [x] AC1-AC3, AC5 complete (AC4 deferred)
