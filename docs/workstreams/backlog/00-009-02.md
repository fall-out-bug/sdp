# 00-009-02: Multi-Project Routing from project-registry.yaml

Feature: F009 (sdp_dev-bxfn)

## Goal

beads-bridge routes issues from multiple projects, setting correct workspace paths, model policies, and labels on AgentRun CRDs.

## Scope Files

- `cmd/beads-bridge/main.go` — add multi-project
- `specs/project-registry.yaml` — existing: project config

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each project in registry gets its own `bd ready` call with correct repo path
- [ ] AgentRun CRD includes labels: `sdp.dev/project`, `sdp.dev/repo`
- [ ] Workspace path resolved from project registry
- [ ] If project has `model_policy`, set it on AgentRun annotation
- [ ] Test: 2 projects with ready issues → AgentRuns created with correct project labels

## Out of Scope

- Cross-project dependency resolution
- Federation bridge (existing code, not part of this WS)

## Implementation Notes

- `project-registry.yaml` already has repo paths and model_policy fields
- Just iterate over projects instead of hardcoding a single project
