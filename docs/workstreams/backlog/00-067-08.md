## Goal

Publish a coherent operator and contributor guide for all F067 changes, including migration steps and rollback guidance.

## Context

F067 changes behavior contracts across agents, CI, release, and repository hygiene. Without clear migration docs, maintainers may unintentionally revert or bypass hardening.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Update top-level docs with final canonical architecture decisions
- [ ] AC2: Publish migration guide for maintainers (before/after behavior)
- [ ] AC3: Document rollback strategy for each hardening area
- [ ] AC4: Update skill/reference docs to remove contradictory instructions
- [ ] AC5: Add contributor checklist for new PRs touching adapters/CI/release
- [ ] AC6: Add "common failure modes" and remediation playbook
- [ ] AC7: Ensure all F067 docs reference canonical files and paths only

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - README.md
  - CLAUDE.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - docs/reference/README.md
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/skills.md
  - docs/reference/configuration.md
  - docs/reference/quality-gates.md
  - docs/reference/2026-02-13-f067-migration-guide.md   # NEW
```

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Guide Structure

1. What changed
2. Why changed
3. What to update in local environments
4. CI/release migration steps
5. Rollback instructions

### Consistency Sweep

Resolve contradictions:
- Python-only command examples in Go-first paths
- legacy paths in adapters and docs
- threshold mismatches in references

### Handoff

Include checklist for future features:
- where to edit prompts
- how to validate adapters
- how to add release changes safely

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Migration guide published
- [ ] Main docs are internally consistent
- [ ] Contributor checklist available
- [ ] AC1-AC7 met
