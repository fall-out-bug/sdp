# 00-056-04: Full Pipeline Evidence Verification

## Goal

End-to-end test: complete feature lifecycle emits unbroken evidence chain from `@idea` through `@deploy`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: E2E test: idea → design → build → review → deploy produces complete chain
- [ ] AC2: `sdp log trace` shows events from every skill type in correct order
- [ ] AC3: `sdp log show --type=X` works for all 4 event types
- [ ] AC4: Chain integrity: no gaps between plan → generation → verification → approval
- [ ] AC5: Documentation updated: evidence coverage matrix (skill → event types)

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go (update — full pipeline test)
- docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md (new — skill × event matrix)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- Capstone for F056 — proves all instrumentation works together
