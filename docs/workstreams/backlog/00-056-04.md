# 00-056-04: Full Pipeline Evidence Verification

## Goal

End-to-end test: complete feature lifecycle emits unbroken evidence chain from `@idea` through `@deploy`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: E2E test: idea → design → build → review → deploy produces complete chain
- [x] AC2: `sdp log trace` shows events from every skill type in correct order
- [x] AC3: `sdp log show --type=X` works for all 4 event types
- [x] AC4: Chain integrity: no gaps between plan → generation → verification → approval
- [x] AC5: Documentation updated: evidence coverage matrix (skill → event types)

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go (update — full pipeline test)
- docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md (new — skill × event matrix)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/integration_test.go

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- Capstone for F056 — proves all instrumentation works together

## Execution Report

**Date:** 2026-02-15

### Goal Status: ACHIEVED

All 5 acceptance criteria verified and passing.

### Implementation Summary

All implementation was already in place from previous work:

1. **AC1**: `TestFullPipelineEvidenceChain` in integration_test.go tests the complete chain
2. **AC2**: `sdp log trace` functionality in tracer.go supports filtering by WS and type
3. **AC3**: `FilterByType()` function tested for all 4 core event types
4. **AC4**: `r.Verify()` checks chain integrity (no gaps)
5. **AC5**: `docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md` documents skill × event matrix

### Self-Check Results

- Tests pass: PASS (go test ./internal/evidence/... -v)
- Coverage >= 80%: PASS (evidence: 84.8%)
- No TODO/FIXME: PASS
- Chain integrity verified: PASS
