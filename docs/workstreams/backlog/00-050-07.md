## WS-00-050-07: Telemetry Collector

### 🎯 Goal

Collect usage metrics for improvement. Track: command usage, duration, errors. Local storage, privacy-first, opt-out available.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: Track command invocations
- [ ] AC2: Record duration and success/failure
- [ ] AC3: Store locally (~/.sdp/telemetry.jsonl)
- [ ] AC4: Opt-out mechanism
- [ ] AC5: Export to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Coverage ≥ 80%

**Builds on F041:**
- ✅ `sdp-plugin/` exists (from F041)
- 🆕 Add telemetry to binary

**Commands:** `sdp telemetry status/export/disable`
