## Goal

Split guard.go into smaller files to meet 200 LOC limit.

## Context

Found during TechLead review of F063:
- **Review Area**: TechLead
- **Issue**: guard.go at 397 LOC exceeds 200 LOC limit (98% over)
- **File(s)**: sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/guard.go

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Split guard.go into guard.go + guard_check.go + guard_status.go
- [ ] AC2: All resulting files < 200 LOC
- [ ] AC3: All tests pass after refactor
- [ ] AC4: No functionality changes (pure refactor)

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/guard.go
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/guard_check.go  # NEW
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/guard_status.go  # NEW
```

## Notes

- Source: Review F063 (TechLead)
- Beads ID: sdp-yxrn
- Priority: P1 - quality gate violation
- Estimated effort: 30 min (pure refactor, no logic changes)
