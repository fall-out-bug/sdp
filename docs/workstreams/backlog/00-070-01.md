## Goal

Define a stable failure taxonomy and error-code contract for all critical execution paths.

## Context

Recovery UX depends on reliable classification of failure causes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define failure classes (environment, protocol, dependency, validation, runtime)
- [ ] AC2: Assign canonical error codes and user-facing copy style
- [ ] AC3: Map each class to recommended recovery patterns
- [ ] AC4: Add error-code table to reference docs
- [ ] AC5: Add contract tests for error serialization

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/errors/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/schema/
  - docs/reference/errors.md
  - docs/PROTOCOL.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Error taxonomy is documented and test-covered
- [ ] New failures can be categorized without ad-hoc messaging
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
