## Goal

Update @review, /bugfix, /build, /issue skills to use new resolver and task API.

## Context

Skills currently have ad-hoc ID handling and task creation.

Need to:
1. Use unified resolver for all ID lookups
2. Use task creator for artifact creation
3. Support any ID format as input

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: @review creates workstream MD + beads issue for all findings
- [ ] AC2: /bugfix accepts WS ID, beads ID, or issue ID
- [ ] AC3: /build accepts WS ID or beads ID
- [ ] AC4: /issue uses task creator with auto-classification
- [ ] AC5: All skills update status in both workstream and beads

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - prompts/skills/review/SKILL.md
  - prompts/skills/bugfix/SKILL.md
  - prompts/skills/build/SKILL.md
  - prompts/skills/issue/SKILL.md
```

## Notes

- This is documentation/skill updates, minimal code changes
- Skills call `sdp resolve` and `sdp task create` CLI commands
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
