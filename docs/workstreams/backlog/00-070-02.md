## Goal

Attach explicit recovery playbooks to failure classes and present them automatically.

## Context

Users need immediate actionable steps instead of generic "command failed" output.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define playbook schema keyed by error class/code
- [ ] AC2: Implement lookup and rendering in failure flow
- [ ] AC3: Include fast-path and deep-path recovery options
- [ ] AC4: Support project-specific override hooks
- [ ] AC5: Add tests for playbook selection and rendering

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/recovery/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - docs/reference/errors.md
  - docs/reference/runbooks.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Every P0/P1 failure class has a recovery playbook
- [ ] Recovery instructions are surfaced inline in CLI output
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
