# 00-057-12: CI: Fix Cross-Platform Build job

## Goal

Make all Cross-Platform Build matrix jobs (linux amd64/arm64, darwin amd64/arm64, windows amd64) pass in Go CI.

## Context

Cross-Platform Build job fails in CI (e.g. ubuntu-latest, linux, amd64). Build step uses PowerShell on all runners; possible causes: shell syntax, GOOS/GOARCH, or path issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: All five matrix entries (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64) complete successfully
- [ ] AC2: Artifacts upload step succeeds
- [ ] AC3: No regressions in Build and Test or Lint jobs

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- .github/workflows/go-ci.yml (cross-platform job, steps and matrix)

**Verification:**
- CI run for a branch; inspect each matrix job log

## Notes

- Job uses `shell: pwsh`; on Ubuntu/macOS runners PowerShell must be available and GOOS/GOARCH must be set correctly.
