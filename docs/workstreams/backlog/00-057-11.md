# 00-057-11: CI: Fix Contract Validation job

## Goal

Make the Go CI "Contract Validation" job pass (or skip cleanly when no contracts), so PR #17 and future PRs are not blocked.

## Context

Contract Validation job fails in CI. When `sdp-plugin/.contracts` has YAML files, the job runs `sdp contract validate` and fails if the report contains ERROR lines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Contract Validation job either passes when contracts exist or skips when none
- [ ] AC2: No false failures from script (e.g. bash array, path, or conditional)
- [ ] AC3: If contracts are validated, errors are fixed or documented as accepted

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- .github/workflows/go-ci.yml (contract-validation job)
- sdp-plugin/.contracts/*.yaml (if present; fix or document)

**Verification:**
- CI run for a branch with and without .contracts

## Notes

- Worktree may not have `.contracts`; verify against main repo or CI logs.
