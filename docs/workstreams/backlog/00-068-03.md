## Goal

Rework help and status surfaces so users can discover commands and workflow state without guessing.

## Context

Discoverability is currently distributed across README, skill prompts, and CLI help with inconsistent framing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define canonical command map grouped by user intent
- [ ] AC2: Align `sdp --help`, `sdp status`, and docs terminology
- [ ] AC3: Add contextual examples for each major command path
- [ ] AC4: Add "common journeys" table (new feature, continue run, recover failure)
- [ ] AC5: Validate clarity with UX checklist and update docs accordingly

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - README.md
  - CLAUDE.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Help output and docs share one command vocabulary
- [ ] Status output points to deterministic next actions
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
