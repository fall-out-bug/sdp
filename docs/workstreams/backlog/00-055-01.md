# 00-055-01: Compliance Reference Document

## Goal

Write the main compliance document covering all enterprise questions about SDP's evidence layer.

## Context

Enterprise customers (bank, airline) need this document before security/governance review. Every stakeholder conversation currently reinvents these answers. One canonical source of truth.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md` exists
- [ ] AC2: Section: Data Residency — where evidence lives, what leaves the repo
- [ ] AC3: Section: Retention & GDPR — customer controls, right to erasure, no PII in evidence
- [ ] AC4: Section: Access Control — git permissions, no separate RBAC in P0, P2 roadmap
- [ ] AC5: Section: Integrity Guarantees — honest labeling (corruption detection, NOT tamper-proof)
- [ ] AC6: Section: Prompt Privacy — hash only, never raw prompts, what IS stored
- [ ] AC7: Section: Regulatory Alignment — SOC2, HIPAA, DORA, EU AI Act mapping
- [ ] AC8: References F054 evidence schema (link to schema/evidence.schema.json)
- [ ] AC9: Explicit "What SDP Does NOT Guarantee" section

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md (new)

**Tests:**
- N/A (document)

## Verification

```bash
# Document exists and has all required sections
grep -c "## " docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md  # Should be 7+ sections
# No promises about tamper-proof
grep -i "tamper.proof" docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md  # Should NOT appear as a claim
```

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- Depends on F054 evidence schema being defined (00-054-03) — need to reference actual schema
- Tone: honest, specific, no overselling. "Corruption detection" not "immutable audit trail"
- Use case study: bank, airline, marketplace — what each cares about
