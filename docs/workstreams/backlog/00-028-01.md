# 00-028-01: CI Cleanup — Remove K8s Jobs and Dead Dependencies

Feature: F028 (sdp_dev-jd2q)
Phase: 7 (Dogfood Bootstrap)
Status: Done

## Goal

Remove post-pivot debris from CI and the Go module. The K8s code was archived to `archive/k8s-v0` branch in Phase 2, but CI still referenced the deleted binaries and Kubernetes manifests.

## Scope Files

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `go.mod`
- `go.sum`
- `api/v1alpha1/` (deleted)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `k8s-validate` job removed from CI
- [x] `image-build` job removed from CI  
- [x] `e2e-agentrun-minikube` job removed from CI
- [x] `api/v1alpha1/` directory deleted (K8s CRD shim)
- [x] `k8s.io/apimachinery` removed from `go.mod`
- [x] `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` removed from `go.mod`
- [x] `go build ./...` passes
- [x] `go test ./...` passes (all green)
