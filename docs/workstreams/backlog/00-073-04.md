## Goal

Expose policy and quality-gate reasoning so users can understand why runs pass or fail.

## Context

Opaque gate failures increase rework and lower trust in automation outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Attach policy source and failed condition to gate failure output
- [ ] AC2: Provide direct remediation hints tied to failed condition
- [ ] AC3: Show gate decision summary in human and JSON output
- [ ] AC4: Add tests for reasoning blocks and fallback behavior
- [ ] AC5: Update policy docs with example failure explanations

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/quality/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/verify/
  - docs/reference/quality-gates.md
  - docs/reference/explainability.md
  - docs/reference/commands.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Gate failures always include explicit cause and remediation path
- [ ] Policy references are traceable to canonical docs/config
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
