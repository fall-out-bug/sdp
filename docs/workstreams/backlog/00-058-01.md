# 00-058-01: Verify Action Core

## Goal

Create the GitHub Action `sdp-dev/verify-action@v1` that runs SDP verification gates on PRs.

## Context

The action wraps `sdp verify` and `sdp log trace` into a GitHub-native workflow. Self-contained: installs SDP CLI if not present, runs gates, reports results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `action.yml` defines inputs: gates, evidence-required, comment
- [ ] AC2: Action installs SDP CLI binary (from GitHub release)
- [ ] AC3: Runs configured verification gates (types, tests, coverage, evidence)
- [ ] AC4: Exit code 0 = all gates pass, non-zero = failure
- [ ] AC5: Works on `ubuntu-latest` runner
- [ ] AC6: `evidence-required: true` checks evidence chain integrity
- [ ] AC7: Execution time < 2 minutes for average Go project

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- .github/actions/verify/action.yml (new)
- .github/actions/verify/entrypoint.sh (new)
- .github/workflows/sdp-verify-dogfood.yml (new — test on SDP repo itself)

**Tests:**
- .github/workflows/sdp-verify-dogfood.yml (dogfood test)

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Start with shell-based action (entrypoint.sh), not Docker or JS
- Binary install: download from GitHub releases (goreleaser)
- Dogfood: run on SDP's own PRs first
