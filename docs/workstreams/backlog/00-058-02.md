# 00-058-02: PR Evidence Comment

## Goal

Post evidence chain summary as a PR comment after verification runs.

## Context

Teams need to see at a glance: what gates passed, which models generated code, is the evidence chain intact? A PR comment makes this visible without checking CI logs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Action posts/updates a PR comment with verification results
- [ ] AC2: Comment includes gate results table (gate, status, details)
- [ ] AC3: Comment includes evidence summary (event counts by type, models used)
- [ ] AC4: Comment includes chain integrity status
- [ ] AC5: Comment updated on re-run (not duplicated)
- [ ] AC6: `comment: false` disables PR comment
- [ ] AC7: Comment formatted as collapsible markdown (details/summary)

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- .github/actions/verify/comment.sh (new — PR comment logic)
- .github/actions/verify/entrypoint.sh (update — call comment.sh)

**Tests:**
- Manual test on SDP repo PR

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- Use `gh api` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for PR comment
- Comment ID stored to update on re-run (not duplicate)
- Collapsible details for verbose evidence output
