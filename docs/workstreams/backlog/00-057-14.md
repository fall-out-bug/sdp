# 00-057-14: Treat unknown gate values as configuration error

## Goal

Fix the verify action to treat unknown gate values as a configuration error that fails verification, rather than silently recording UNKNOWN and allowing false PASS.

## Context

Current behavior: When an unknown gate is specified (e.g., typo like "typs" instead of "type"), the action:
- Records `UNKNOWN` in results
- Does NOT increment FAILED counter
- Allows workflow to PASS if all other gates pass

This is a security/stability issue - misconfiguration should fail loudly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Unknown gate values increment FAILED counter
- [x] AC2: Unknown gate values cause verification to return non-zero exit code
- [x] AC3: Error message clearly indicates which gate was unknown
- [x] AC4: Test case validates unknown gate behavior

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- `.github/actions/verify/action.yml` (modify - unknown gate case in case statement)

**Verification:**
- Test with invalid gate value: `gates: 'invalid-gate-name'`
- Verify FAILED > 0 and exit code 1
- Verify error message shown

## Notes

- Current code line ~155: `*)` case in gate switch statement
- Change from recording UNKNOWN to incrementing FAILED and exiting
