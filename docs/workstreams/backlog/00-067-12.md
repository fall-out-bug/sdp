## Goal

Create DEVELOPMENT.md with working local setup instructions and configure Dependabot for Go module updates.

## Context

**Missing developer guide**: CONTRIBUTING.md is high-level but doesn't cover required Go version, how to run tests, how to build the CLI, how to run linters locally, or IDE setup recommendations. New contributors face a >30 minute setup experience.

**Missing Go Dependabot**: A `dependabot/pip/rich-14.3.2` branch exists (Python), but no Dependabot configuration for Go modules. Dependencies in `go.mod` / `sdp-plugin/go.mod` can become stale.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Create `DEVELOPMENT.md` with step-by-step local setup
- [ ] AC2: Include: required Go version, build command, test command, lint command
- [ ] AC3: Include: IDE recommendations (VS Code Go extension, GoLand)
- [ ] AC4: Include: how to run specific test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] AC5: Include: how to use SDP skills locally (workflow example)
- [ ] AC6: Create `.github/dependabot.yml` with Go module update schedule
- [ ] AC7: Configure Dependabot for both `go.mod` (root) and `sdp-plugin/go.mod`
- [ ] AC8: New contributor can go from `git clone` to passing tests in <15 minutes

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - DEVELOPMENT.md                     # NEW
  - .github/dependabot.yml            # NEW or UPDATE
  - CONTRIBUTING.md                    # link to DEVELOPMENT.md
  - README.md                         # link to DEVELOPMENT.md
```

## Implementation Notes

### DEVELOPMENT.md Structure

```markdown
# Development Guide

## Prerequisites
- Go X.Y (see .go-version)
- Git 2.30+
- golangci-lint (optional, for local linting)

## Quick Start
git clone https://github.com/fall-out-bug/sdp.git
cd sdp/sdp-plugin
go build -o sdp ./cmd/sdp
go test ./...

## Running Tests
go test ./...                           # all tests
go test -run TestSmoke ./...            # smoke tests only
go test -race -coverprofile=c.out ./... # with coverage

## Linting
golangci-lint run ./...

## Using SDP Skills
# See CLAUDE.md for skill usage guide
```

### Dependabot Config

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "gomod"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "gomod"
    directory: "/sdp-plugin"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] DEVELOPMENT.md exists and is accurate
- [ ] Dependabot configured for Go and GitHub Actions
- [ ] New contributor can set up in <15 minutes (tested)
- [ ] AC1-AC8 met
