## Goal

Make evidence trace output understandable for both engineers and auditors.

## Context

Trace data exists, but practical usability depends on coherent UX and terminology.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define canonical trace narrative order (intent -> generation -> verification -> approval)
- [ ] AC2: Improve `sdp log trace` readability with consistent labels
- [ ] AC3: Align trace output with explainability disclosure levels
- [ ] AC4: Add JSON schema alignment checks for trace payload
- [ ] AC5: Add operator docs for forensic trace interpretation

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/log/
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/explainability.md
  - docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Trace output is understandable without reading implementation code
- [ ] CLI and docs use identical trace vocabulary
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
