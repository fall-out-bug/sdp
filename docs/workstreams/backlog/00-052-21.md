## Goal
Integrate multi-agent deep-thinking into @idea/@design skills

## Scope

### Files to Modify
- `.claude/skills/idea/SKILL.md` - Add deep-thinking mode
- `.claude/skills/design/SKILL.md` - Add deep-thinking mode

### Files to Create
- `src/sdp/thinking/orchestrator.go` - Multi-agent thinking
- `tests/sdp/thinking/orchestrator_test.go` - TDD tests

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: @idea Enhanced Mode (10 agents)
- Product, market, technical, UX, business, growth, risk, security, performance, compliance
- Run in parallel when possible
- Synthesize results using rules engine

### AC2: @design Lightweight Mode (3-5 agents)
- Architecture, security, performance
- Focused on design-specific concerns
- Faster than @idea mode

### AC3: Synthesizer Integration
- Use Phase 4 synthesizer for agent results
- Apply synthesis rules in priority order
- Handle disagreements between agents

## Definition of Done
