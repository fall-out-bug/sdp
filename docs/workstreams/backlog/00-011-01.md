# 00-011-01: kubeopencode UP-001 Retry Budget PR

Feature: F011 (sdp_dev-5cn2)

## Goal

Contribute retry budget functionality upstream to kubeopencode. Tasks that fail should respect a retry budget instead of retrying infinitely.

## Scope Files

- External: kubeopencode repo
- `docs/drafts/` — design notes for upstream contribution

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PR submitted to kubeopencode with retry budget feature
- [ ] Task CRD gets `spec.retryBudget` field (max retries, backoff)
- [ ] Task controller respects budget: stops retrying after N attempts
- [ ] Tests included in the PR
- [ ] PR is in review or merged

## Out of Scope

- Evidence hooks (00-011-02)
- Changes to SDP adapter-controller

## Implementation Notes

- kubeopencode already has some subtasks tracked: sdp_dev-j2b.1.7 through sdp_dev-j2b.1.11
- Consolidate those subtasks into a single clean PR
- Follow kubeopencode contribution guidelines
