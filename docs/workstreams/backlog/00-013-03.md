# 00-013-03: Swarm Operations Runbook

Feature: F013 (sdp_dev-x9j1)

## Goal

Document how to operate the autonomous swarm: setup, monitoring, troubleshooting, common failure modes.

## Scope Files

- `docs/K8S_SWARM_E2E_RUNBOOK.md` — rewrite (exists but outdated)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prerequisites: cluster setup, NATS, kubeopencode, beads
- [ ] How to deploy: adapter-controller, beads-bridge, model-policy ConfigMap
- [ ] How to monitor: kubectl commands, key status fields
- [ ] How to troubleshoot: common failures and fixes
- [ ] How to add a new project to the swarm
- [ ] How to adjust model policy and budget
- [ ] Validated against actual 10-run experience from 00-013-02

## Out of Scope

- Grafana dashboards
- Alerting setup

## Implementation Notes

- Rewrite existing K8S_SWARM_E2E_RUNBOOK.md with lessons learned from the 10 consecutive runs
- Include real examples from successful and failed runs
- Keep it practical: copy-paste commands that work
