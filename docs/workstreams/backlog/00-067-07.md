## Goal

Eliminate generated binary artifacts from source control policy and establish explicit evidence-log tracking policy.

## Context

Tracked generated binaries and large runtime logs increase repository weight, create platform-specific noise, and reduce signal-to-noise in reviews.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Identify and classify tracked generated artifacts (binaries, temp outputs, logs)
- [ ] AC2: Remove generated binaries from tracked source set
- [ ] AC3: Update `.gitignore` and related policy docs to prevent reintroduction
- [ ] AC4: Define evidence log policy (tracked baseline vs generated runtime logs)
- [ ] AC5: Ensure `.gitattributes` and merge strategy match evidence policy
- [ ] AC6: Add CI check to detect newly tracked binary artifacts
- [ ] AC7: Publish migration note for maintainers about cleanup impact

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - .gitignore
  - .gitattributes
  - sdp-plugin/.gitattributes
  - docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md
  - docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md
  - docs/reference/configuration.md
  - .github/workflows/go-ci.yml                     # optional binary-tracking check
```

## Implementation Notes

### Artifact Policy

Define categories:
1. Source artifacts (must be tracked)
2. Generated build artifacts (must not be tracked)
3. Runtime telemetry/evidence artifacts (policy-based)

### Binary Detection

Add lightweight check:
- fail if newly tracked executable binaries are detected in disallowed paths
- allowlist only intentional binary fixtures (if any)

### Evidence Tradeoff

Policy must balance:
- reproducibility/auditability
- repository growth
- merge conflict behavior

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Generated binaries are no longer tracked as source
- [ ] Evidence tracking policy is explicit and documented
- [ ] CI prevents accidental binary reintroduction
- [ ] AC1-AC7 met
