# 00-030-01: Branch Protection — Configure GitHub Required Checks

Feature: F030 (sdp_dev-tsi6)
Phase: 7 (Dogfood Bootstrap)
Status: Backlog

## Goal

Configure GitHub branch protection on `master` to require CI gates before merging. This makes enforcement server-side and bypass-proof — the critical last mile of the Phase 1 enforcement foundation.

## Scope Files

- `.github/` (branch protection is configured via GitHub API or UI, no files changed)

## What to Configure

Via GitHub repository Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule for `master`:

- Required status checks: `build-test`, `evidence-gate`, `policy-gate`
- "Require branches to be up to date before merging": enabled
- "Do not allow bypassing the above settings": enabled
- "Restrict who can push to matching branches": optional (repo owner only)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Branch protection rule exists for `master` in GitHub repository settings
- [ ] Required checks: `build-test`, `evidence-gate`, `policy-gate`
- [ ] "Do not allow bypassing" is enabled
- [ ] Test: attempt to push directly to master without passing CI → rejected

## Blocker

GitHub branch protection requires GitHub Pro (or a public repository) for private repos.
Current repo is private on a free account. Options:
1. Upgrade to GitHub Pro
2. Make repository public (enables branch protection for free)
3. Use CODEOWNERS + required reviews as a partial substitute

Until unblocked, enforcement relies on the CI gates themselves (evidence-gate, policy-gate) plus developer discipline.
