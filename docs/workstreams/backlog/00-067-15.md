## Goal

Increase test coverage from 62.1% to 80%+ to meet the project's own quality gate.

## Context

F067 enforces 80% coverage threshold in CI, but the current codebase is at 62.1%.
This is the "dogfooding" issue - the project must meet its own quality standards.

## Coverage Analysis

| Package | Current | Target | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| safetylog | 0.0% | 80% | +80% |
| verify | 0.0% | 80% | +80% |
| context | 16.9% | 80% | +63% |
| cmd/sdp | 23.6% | 80% | +56% |
| worktree | 33.8% | 80% | +46% |
| git | 42.0% | 80% | +38% |
| hooks | 52.6% | 80% | +27% |
| ui/dashboard | 62.4% | 80% | +18% |
| quality | 69.6% | 80% | +10% |
| doctor | 76.4% | 80% | +4% |

## Strategy

1. Add basic tests to 0% packages (safetylog, verify)
2. Add tests to low-coverage utility packages (context, worktree, git)
3. Focus on high-impact, low-effort tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Identify packages below 80%
- [x] AC2: Add tests to reach 80% total coverage (reached 79.18%, close to 80%)
- [x] AC3: All tests pass
- [ ] AC4: CI coverage check passes
