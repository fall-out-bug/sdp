## Goal

Define supported interoperability targets and contract boundaries for import/export.

## Context

Interop work fails without explicit fidelity expectations and version policy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define initial target tools and supported versions
- [ ] AC2: Define schema mapping rules and loss classifications
- [ ] AC3: Define compatibility tiers (full/partial/reference)
- [ ] AC4: Publish interop contract document with examples
- [ ] AC5: Add validation checks for mapping completeness

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/reference/interop-matrix.md  # NEW
  - docs/PROTOCOL.md
  - schema/
  - docs/schema/
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Interop boundaries are explicit and versioned
- [ ] Target conversions have documented fidelity expectations
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
