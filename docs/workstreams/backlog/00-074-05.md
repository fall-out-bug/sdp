## Goal

Define guardrails that keep public OSS layers (`L0-L2`) decoupled from non-public extensions.

## Context

Public adoption confidence depends on clear boundaries and absence of hidden dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define guardrails preventing non-public dependencies in `L0-L2`
- [ ] AC2: Define CI checks for boundary violations in public artifacts
- [ ] AC3: Define docs policy: public repo tracks public OSS scope only
- [ ] AC4: Define remediation process when decoupling rules are violated
- [ ] AC5: Publish boundary guardrails in vision/reference docs

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - PRODUCT_VISION.md
  - docs/vision/LAYERED-ADOPTION.md
  - docs/vision/ROADMAP.md
  - docs/reference/installation.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Public boundary is explicit, reviewable, and enforceable
- [ ] Guardrails are integrated into public release process
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
