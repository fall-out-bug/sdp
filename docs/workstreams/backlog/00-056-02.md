# 00-056-02: Design & Idea Instrumentation

## Goal

Instrument `@design` and `@idea` skills to emit plan events. Record decomposition decisions and requirements gathering.

## Context

`@design` creates workstreams (decomposition decisions, dependency graph). `@idea` gathers requirements (questions asked, answers in drive mode). Both are plan-phase events.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `@design` completion emits `plan` event (WS count, dependency graph, architecture decisions)
- [ ] AC2: `@idea` completion emits `plan` event (question count, requirements summary)
- [ ] AC3: In drive mode, `@idea` records question-answer pairs in evidence
- [ ] AC4: Plan events include feature_id and decomposition metadata
- [ ] AC5: Tests for plan event emissions

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/parse.go (update — emit plan event after WS parsing)
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter.go (update — add plan helpers)
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go (update)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- `@design` is a Claude skill but calls `sdp parse` — instrument there
- `@idea` has no CLI command yet — may need a new `sdp idea` command stub for evidence
