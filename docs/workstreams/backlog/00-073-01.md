## Goal

Define explainability contract: what rationale is mandatory at each UX disclosure level.

## Context

Trust requires consistent reasoning visibility across commands, modes, and artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define disclosure levels (brief, standard, audit)
- [ ] AC2: Define mandatory rationale fields per level
- [ ] AC3: Map levels to command flags and output channels
- [ ] AC4: Add schema + examples for rationale payload
- [ ] AC5: Document tradeoffs between brevity and auditability

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/PROTOCOL.md
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/explainability.md  # NEW
  - sdp-plugin/internal/schema/
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Explainability contract is versioned and testable
- [ ] Output levels are documented with clear defaults
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
