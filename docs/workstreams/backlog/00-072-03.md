## Goal

Implement export pipeline from SDP protocol to selected external formats.

## Context

Export preserves optionality and reduces lock-in concerns for evaluators.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define export profiles and fidelity metadata
- [ ] AC2: Implement export renderer for selected targets
- [ ] AC3: Include explicit markers for unsupported fields
- [ ] AC4: Add golden tests for deterministic output
- [ ] AC5: Add CLI entrypoint for export with JSON summary

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/exporter/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/schema/
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/interop-matrix.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Export output is deterministic and version-tagged
- [ ] Lossy/unsupported fields are surfaced explicitly
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
