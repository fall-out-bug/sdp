# 00-059-01: Observability Bridge Design Document

## Goal

Write the design document specifying how SDP evidence connects to production observability tools.

## Context

Evidence answers "what happened during build." Observability answers "what's happening in production." The bridge connects them: deploy marker → evidence chain → root cause. Without it, evidence stays disconnected from production incidents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `docs/design/OBSERVABILITY-BRIDGE.md` exists
- [ ] AC2: Section: Deploy Markers — how SDP metadata attaches to deploy events
- [ ] AC3: Section: OTel Span Attributes — proposed semantic convention for AI-generated code
- [ ] AC4: Section: Diff-Level Provenance — algorithm for per-line AI/human attribution
- [ ] AC5: Section: Integration Architecture — data flow diagrams (evidence → deploy → runtime → incident)
- [ ] AC6: Section: Integration Points — Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana specifics
- [ ] AC7: Sufficient detail to implement P2 without design questions

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- docs/design/OBSERVABILITY-BRIDGE.md (new)

**Tests:**
- N/A (document)

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Research: OTel semantic conventions for code generation (if any exist)
- Key decision: push (SDP exports) vs pull (observability tools query SDP)
- Deploy markers: git tags with SDP metadata or OTel deploy events?
