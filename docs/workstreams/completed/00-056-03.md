# 00-056-03: Remaining Skills Instrumentation

## Goal

Instrument all remaining skills: `@vision`, `@reality`, `@oneshot`, `@prototype`, `@hotfix`, `@bugfix`, `@issue`, `@debug`.

## Context

These skills are lower-priority but needed for complete pipeline coverage. Most call existing CLI commands — just add evidence emit at the right points.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `@vision` emits `plan` event (strategic decisions)
- [ ] AC2: `@reality` emits `verification` event (codebase analysis results)
- [ ] AC3: `@oneshot` emits `plan` event (execution plan) + `approval` (completion)
- [ ] AC4: `@prototype` emits `generation` event (code generated)
- [ ] AC5: `@hotfix` emits `generation` + `approval` (emergency fix, fast-track)
- [ ] AC6: `@bugfix` emits `generation` + `verification` (fix + tests)
- [ ] AC7: `@issue` emits `plan` event (severity classification, routing)
- [ ] AC8: `@debug` emits `verification` event (hypotheses tested, root cause)
- [ ] AC9: All events non-blocking — failure doesn't break the skill

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter.go (update — add skill-specific helpers)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/prototype.go (update)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/orchestrate.go (update — oneshot)
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go (update)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Batch: these are lower-priority skills — thin evidence (event type + timestamp + ws_id)
- Some skills have no CLI command — may need stub commands or skip evidence for pure Claude skills
