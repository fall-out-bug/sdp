# 00-059-02: OTel Semantic Convention Draft

## Goal

Define OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for SDP telemetry events, enabling integration with OTel-compatible observability platforms.

## Context

Building on the observability bridge design (00-059-01), this workstream establishes semantic conventions that align SDP telemetry with OpenTelemetry standards for better interoperability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Event types map to OTel semantic conventions (command events as spans, quality gates as metrics)
- [x] AC2: Tracker provides automatic command tracking with duration measurement
- [x] AC3: Status reporting includes enabled state, event count, and file path
- [x] AC4: Report generation supports date range filtering
- [x] AC5: Command statistics include success rate and average duration
- [x] AC6: Error categorization for top error analysis

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/tracker.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/tracker_methods.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/tracker_helpers.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/analyzer_stats.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/analyzer_report_helpers.go

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/tracker_test.go
- sdp-plugin/internal/telemetry/consent_persistence_test.go

## Notes

- Tracker is a singleton for consistent event collection
- Duration tracking uses time.Time for accuracy
- Statistics calculations are efficient (single-pass aggregation)
