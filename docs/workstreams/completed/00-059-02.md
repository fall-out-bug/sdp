# 00-059-02: OTel Semantic Convention Draft

## Goal

Draft an informal OTel semantic convention for AI-generated code provenance. Position SDP as a contributor to the standard.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `docs/design/OTEL-AI-PROVENANCE.md` proposes span attributes
- [ ] AC2: Covers: `sdp.ai_generated`, `sdp.model`, `sdp.evidence_id`, `sdp.verification_status`
- [ ] AC3: Compatible with existing OTel semantic conventions
- [ ] AC4: Example spans showing AI-generated vs human code paths
- [ ] AC5: Discussion: resource attributes vs span attributes vs log attributes
- [ ] AC6: Reviewed against OTel spec guidelines

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- docs/design/OTEL-AI-PROVENANCE.md (new)

**Tests:**
- N/A (document)

## Notes

- ~1.5h work
- This is pre-standardization — informal draft, not a formal OTel proposal
- Value: positions SDP in the observability conversation early
- Could become a real OTel proposal if there's community interest
