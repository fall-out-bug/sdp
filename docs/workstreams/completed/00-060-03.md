# 00-060-03: Contract-First Build & Integration

## Goal

`@build` respects shared contracts: validates that workstream output matches the agreed interface. Integrate into `@design` flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: `sdp contract validate` checks implementation against locked contracts
- [x] AC2: `@build` runs contract validation after code generation
- [x] AC3: Contract violation = build warning (not error in P1; enforcement in P2)
- [x] AC4: `@design` suggests contracts when parallel features detected
- [x] AC5: E2E test: two features with shared boundary → contract → both build → validation
- [x] AC6: Documentation: contract workflow guide

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/contract.go (update — enhance validate)
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/guard.go (update — contract check on activate)
- docs/reference/CONTRACT-WORKFLOW.md (new)
- sdp-plugin/internal/collision/integration_test.go (new)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/collision/integration_test.go

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Capstone for F060 — proves the contract-first workflow
- Warning, not error: teams adopt gradually (P2 adds enforcement)
- This completes P1 of the North Star path
