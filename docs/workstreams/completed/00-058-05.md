# 00-058-05: Add continue-on-error to invalid gate test

## Goal

Fix integration-test job in test-verify-action.yml to not fail when "Test error handling - invalid gate" step fails. Add verification step to check failure and set outputs.result correctly.

## Context

Current issue: "Test error handling - invalid gate" step runs as action with invalid gate. The action correctly fails (exit 1). When this step fails, the next step never runs. So integration-test job fails every time.

Root cause: The "Test error handling - invalid gate" step has `continue-on-error: true` which prevents the job from failing when the action itself fails. But it should allow the action to fail and fail the job.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Add `continue-on-error: true` to "Test error handling - invalid gate" step
- [ ] AC2: Add verification step after invalid gate test to check outputs.result
- [ ] AC3: Verify integration-test job passes with invalid gate
- [ ] AC4: Verify outputs.result is set correctly

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- `.github/workflows/test-verify-action.yml` (modify)
  - Remove `continue-on-error: true` from "Test error handling - invalid gate" job
  - Add verification step to check job status

**Tests:**
- `.github/workflows/test-verify-action.yml` (verify)
  - Integration test passes with invalid gate
  - outputs.result is set correctly

## Notes

- The "Test error handling - invalid gate" test intentionally passes an invalid gate name to the action
- The action should fail with exit code 1
- The test should verify this failure occurred
- Other test jobs should still run after this failure
