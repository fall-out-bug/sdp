## Goal

Make resume behavior explicit and reliable after interruptions, crashes, or partial failures.

## Context

Checkpoint primitives exist, but UX around resume state and choices is still opaque.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Show checkpoint state summary before resume
- [ ] AC2: Offer safe resume options (continue/retry/abort)
- [ ] AC3: Add corruption and mismatch handling with clear remediation
- [ ] AC4: Add tests for interrupted multi-step sessions
- [ ] AC5: Document operator recovery flow for checkpoint incidents

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/checkpoint/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/orchestrator/
  - docs/reference/runbooks.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Resume path is deterministic across supported interruption cases
- [ ] Recovery decisions are visible and auditable
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
