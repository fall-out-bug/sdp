# 00-056-01: Review & Deploy Instrumentation

## Goal

Instrument `@review` and `@deploy` skills to emit evidence events. These complete the generation → verification → approval chain started by `@build` in F054.

## Context

`@review` calls multi-agent quality check (QA, Security, DevOps, SRE, TechLead, Documentation). Each reviewer finding should be a verification event. `@deploy` merges code and should emit an approval event.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `sdp verify` (called by `@review`) emits `verification` event per gate result
- [ ] AC2: Verification events include actual reviewer output (findings, severity)
- [ ] AC3: `@deploy` merge step emits `approval` event (who approved, gates passed)
- [ ] AC4: Approval event includes merge target branch and commit SHA
- [ ] AC5: Evidence chain: `@build` generation → `@review` verification → `@deploy` approval
- [ ] AC6: Tests for new event emissions

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/verify.go (update — add review evidence)
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter.go (update — add review/deploy helpers)
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go (update)

**Tests:**
- sdp-plugin/internal/evidence/emitter_test.go

## Notes

- ~2h work
- Highest leverage after `@build` — completes the core chain
- `@review` already calls CLI commands — just add evidence emit
