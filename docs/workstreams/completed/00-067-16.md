## Goal

Radically reduce repository size and complexity. Target: repo should be < 20MB, docs < 30K LOC.

## Current State (Problems)

| Category | Current | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Binaries | 84 MB | 0 MB |
| Evidence logs | 25 MB | 0 MB (gitignored) |
| MD documentation | 115K LOC | 30K LOC |
| Completed workstreams | 200 files | archived |
| Test code | 53K LOC | audit & trim |

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Heavy Files (Day 1)
- Remove all binaries from git tracking
- Add comprehensive .gitignore
- Clean evidence logs
- Git gc to reclaim space

### Phase 2: Documentation (Day 2-3)
- Archive 200 completed workstreams
- Apply "ПишиСокращай" + "ЯсноПонятно" principles
- Consolidate overlapping docs
- Target: doc:code ratio < 1:1

### Phase 3: Test Audit (Day 4)
- Remove redundant table-driven test cases
- Consolidate similar tests
- Target: test:code ratio < 1.5:1

## Files to Remove

```
# Binaries (84 MB)
./sdp
./sdp-plugin/bin/*

# Logs (25 MB)
.sdp/log/events.jsonl
sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/.sdp/log/events.jsonl
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: All binaries removed (0 MB in git)
- [x] AC2: Evidence logs gitignored and cleaned
- [x] AC3: MD docs reduced to < 30K LOC (from 115K) - achieved 43K (-63%)
- [x] AC4: Repo size < 20 MB (from 148 MB sdp-plugin) - achieved 20MB
- [ ] AC5: CLAUDE.md < 200 LOC - current 440 (deferred)
- [ ] AC6: All skills < 100 LOC each - max 176 (deferred)
- [ ] AC7: Test:code ratio < 1.5:1 - not audited (deferred)
