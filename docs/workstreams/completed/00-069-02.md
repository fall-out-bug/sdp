## Goal

Implement deterministic recommendation logic that converts current state into the best next action.

## Context

Users lose momentum when they must infer next steps after commands complete or fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Build recommendation resolver using 00-069-01 contract
- [ ] AC2: Cover common states (fresh project, in-progress WS, blocked WS, failed WS)
- [ ] AC3: Provide deterministic fallback when confidence is low
- [ ] AC4: Add test matrix for edge cases and conflicting signals
- [ ] AC5: Emit machine-readable output for scripting and UI

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/internal/orchestrator/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/status/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/json/
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Resolver handles defined states without nondeterministic output
- [ ] Test matrix is green and documented
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
