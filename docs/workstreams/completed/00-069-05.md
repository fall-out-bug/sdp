## Goal

Define and enforce quality metrics for next-step recommendations before broader rollout.

## Context

Recommendation systems drift without explicit quality evaluation and release gates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define quality metrics (acceptance rate, correction rate, time saved)
- [ ] AC2: Add measurement hooks to recommendation surfaces
- [ ] AC3: Define minimum quality thresholds for release readiness
- [ ] AC4: Publish rollout report with observed metrics
- [ ] AC5: Open follow-up backlog for weak recommendation states

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - docs/reference/2026-02-14-f069-recommendation-metrics.md

```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Metrics are reproducible and visible to maintainers
- [ ] Release decision includes recommendation quality review
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
