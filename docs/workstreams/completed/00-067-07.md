## Goal

Eliminate generated binary artifacts from source control and establish explicit evidence-log tracking policy.

## Context

Tracked generated binaries and large runtime logs increase repository weight, create platform-specific noise, and reduce signal-to-noise in reviews.

Additionally, files like `coverage_quality.out` are committed to the repo — these are build artifacts that should be in `.gitignore`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Identify and classify tracked generated artifacts (binaries, temp outputs, logs)
- [x] AC2: Remove generated binaries from tracked source set
- [x] AC3: Update `.gitignore` to prevent reintroduction (coverage files, build artifacts, .sdp/memory.db)
- [x] AC4: Define evidence log policy (tracked baseline vs generated runtime logs)
- [x] AC5: Ensure `.gitattributes` and merge strategy match evidence policy
- [x] AC6: Add CI check to detect newly tracked binary artifacts
- [x] AC7: Publish migration note for maintainers about cleanup impact

## Migration Note (AC7)

**For maintainers:** After this workstream, the following changes are in effect:

1. **Removed from tracking:** `coverage_quality.out` - was a build artifact
2. **Added to .gitignore:** `.sdp/memory.db`, `.sdp/checkpoints/`, `bin/`, `dist/`
3. **Evidence policy:** Documented in `docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md`
4. **CI enforcement:** New check prevents tracked `.out` files and `bin/`/`dist/` directories

**Action required:** Run `git pull` and ensure local `.out` files are not re-added to tracking.

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - .gitignore
  - .gitattributes
  - coverage_quality.out            # remove from tracking
  - docs/reference/EVIDENCE-COVERAGE.md
  - docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md
  - .github/workflows/go-ci.yml    # optional binary-tracking check
```

## Implementation Notes

### Artifact Categories

1. **Source artifacts** — must be tracked
2. **Generated build artifacts** — must NOT be tracked (`*.out`, `bin/`, `dist/`)
3. **Runtime evidence** — policy-based (`.sdp/log/events.jsonl` tracked for auditability)

### .gitignore Additions

```gitignore
# Build artifacts
*.out
bin/
dist/
.sdp/memory.db

# IDE
.idea/
*.swp
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Generated binaries are no longer tracked as source
- [ ] Evidence tracking policy is explicit and documented
- [ ] CI prevents accidental binary reintroduction
- [ ] AC1-AC7 met
