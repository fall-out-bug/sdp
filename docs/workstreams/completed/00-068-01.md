## Goal

Freeze measurable UX baseline for onboarding, discoverability, and first successful execution.

## Context

F067 hardens engineering quality. F068 starts UX hardening, which requires a baseline before interventions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Define metric dictionary (`TTFV`, first successful `sdp apply`, first successful recovery)
- [ ] AC2: Capture baseline from existing evidence/log sources for latest runs
- [ ] AC3: Identify top 10 friction points in current onboarding path
- [ ] AC4: Publish target ranges for F068-F073 UX metrics
- [ ] AC5: Save baseline report with explicit measurement method

## Scope Files
