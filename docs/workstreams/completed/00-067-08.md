## Goal

Publish a coherent operator and contributor guide for all F067 changes, including migration steps and rollback guidance.

## Context

F067 changes behavior contracts across agents, CI, release, and repository hygiene. Without clear migration docs, maintainers may unintentionally revert or bypass hardening.

This is the final WS in F067 — it consolidates all changes into user-facing documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Update top-level docs with final canonical architecture decisions → DEVELOPMENT.md, ADR-001
- [x] AC2: Publish migration guide (before/after behavior for each change area) → docs/reference/2026-02-13-f067-migration-guide.md
- [x] AC3: Document rollback strategy for each hardening area → Migration guide includes rollback section
- [x] AC4: Update skill/reference docs to remove contradictory instructions → quality-gates.md marked Python examples
- [x] AC5: Add contributor checklist for new PRs touching adapters/CI/release → Added to CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] AC6: Add "common failure modes" and remediation playbook → Migration guide includes failure modes
- [x] AC7: Ensure all F067 docs reference canonical files and paths only → Verified
- [x] AC8: Version consistency — README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md all say same SDP version → All now 0.10.0

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - README.md
  - CLAUDE.md
  - AGENTS.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - docs/reference/README.md
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - docs/reference/skills.md
  - docs/reference/configuration.md
  - docs/reference/quality-gates.md
  - docs/reference/2026-02-13-f067-migration-guide.md   # NEW
```

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Guide Structure

1. What changed and why
2. Breaking changes (paths, thresholds, enforcement)
3. What to update in local environments
4. CI/release migration steps
5. Rollback instructions per area

### Consistency Sweep

Resolve contradictions:
- Python-only command examples in Go-first paths
- Legacy paths in adapters and docs
- Threshold mismatches in references
- Version string mismatches (0.9.0 vs 0.10.0)

### Contributor Checklist

Include in CONTRIBUTING.md:
- Where to edit prompts (canonical path only)
- How to validate adapters (run path check)
- How to add release changes safely
- Required Go version and how to verify

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Migration guide published
- [ ] Main docs are internally consistent
- [ ] Contributor checklist available
- [ ] No version string mismatches across docs
- [ ] AC1-AC8 met
