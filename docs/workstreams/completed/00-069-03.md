## Goal

Expose recommendation output consistently in `status`, `help`, and failure messages.

## Context

Recommendation quality has no user value unless surfaced at the exact decision points.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Add "Next Step" block to `sdp status`
- [ ] AC2: Add journey-focused section to `sdp --help`
- [ ] AC3: Attach recovery-focused recommendation to key error outputs
- [ ] AC4: Ensure JSON mode includes same recommendation payload
- [ ] AC5: Update docs screenshots/examples for new output

## Scope Files

```yaml
scope_files:
  - sdp-plugin/cmd/sdp/main.go
  - sdp-plugin/internal/status/
  - sdp-plugin/internal/ui/
  - docs/reference/commands.md
  - README.md
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Next-step guidance appears in all targeted CLI surfaces
- [ ] Human and JSON outputs remain aligned
- [ ] AC1-AC5 complete
