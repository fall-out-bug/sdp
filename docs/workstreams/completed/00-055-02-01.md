# 00-055-02: Threat Model & Documentation Update

## Goal

### 🎯 Goal

Write the threat model document and integrate compliance docs into the project.

## Context

Compliance doc (00-055-01) answers "what does SDP do." Threat model answers "what can go wrong and what SDP doesn't protect against." Together they give enterprise security teams a complete picture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: `docs/compliance/THREAT-MODEL.md` exists
- [x] AC2: Section: Assets — what SDP protects (evidence integrity, code provenance)
- [x] AC3: Section: Threats — tampering, impersonation, data loss, privacy leak
- [x] AC4: Section: Mitigations — what SDP does for each threat (P0-P3 roadmap)
- [x] AC5: Section: Accepted Risks — explicit list of what is NOT mitigated in P0
- [x] AC6: Section: Future Mitigations — P3 signed evidence, external timestamping
- [x] AC7: CLAUDE.md updated with compliance doc references
- [x] AC8: README or NAVIGATION.md links to compliance docs

## Scope Files

**Implementation:**
- docs/compliance/THREAT-MODEL.md (new)
- CLAUDE.md (update — add compliance section)
- docs/NAVIGATION.md (update if exists)

**Tests:**
- N/A (document)

## Verification

```bash
# Documents exist
test -f docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md && test -f docs/compliance/THREAT-MODEL.md
# CLAUDE.md references compliance
grep -q "compliance" CLAUDE.md
```

## Notes

- ~1h work
- Threat model format: lightweight (not STRIDE/PASTA — just clear prose)
- Key honesty point: "In P0, a repo admin can modify the evidence log. We detect corruption but don't prevent it. P3 adds signed records."
- This completes F055 — two docs, integrated into project navigation

### Execution Report

- **Completed:** 2026-02-10
- **Artifacts:** `docs/compliance/THREAT-MODEL.md` (Assets, Threats, Mitigations, Accepted Risks, Future Mitigations); CLAUDE.md Resources table updated; README Documentation table updated with compliance links.
- **Verification:** `test -f docs/compliance/COMPLIANCE.md && test -f docs/compliance/THREAT-MODEL.md` and `grep -q "compliance" CLAUDE.md` pass.
- **Post-build:** Go build and test in sdp-plugin.
