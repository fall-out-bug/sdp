### 2. Four-Level Planning Model

```
Strategic ( quarterly )        Analysis ( per project )         Feature ( per feature )      Execution ( per feature )
┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐
│  @vision     │              │  @reality     │              │  @feature    │              │  @oneshot     │

```

### 3. Fault Tolerance

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- Three states: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN
- Threshold: 3 failures trigger trip
- Exponential backoff: 60s → 120s → 240s (max 5min)
- Automatic recovery with state persistence

**Checkpoint System:**
- Atomic writes: temp file → fsync → atomic rename
- State serialization: completed, failed, graph, circuit breaker
- Automatic recovery: restores from checkpoint on restart
- Crash-safe: prevents corruption on power loss

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

**Problem:** Previous versions asked unbounded questions (15-50+ per feature)

**Solution:** 3-question cycles with trigger points
- Cycle 1: Core questions (3)
- Trigger point: Continue? Deep Design? Skip?
- Cycle 2: Deep dive (3)
- Trigger point: Continue? Skip? Done?
- Target: 12-27 questions per feature (74% reduction)

### 5. Parallel Execution

**Speedup:** 4.96x for 5-10 workstreams
- 5 WS: 55ms → 11ms (5.0x faster)
- 10 WS: 109ms → 22ms (4.95x faster)

**Algorithm:** Kahn's topological sort with configurable concurrency (3-5 workers)

**Safety:** Dependency-aware parallelization (no unsafe concurrent execution)

## 📊 Quality Metrics

| Metric | v0.7.0 | v0.9.0 | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | 68% | 83.2% | +15.2% |
| Total LOC | ~1,500 | 2,762 | +84% |
| Max File Size | 343 LOC | 154 LOC | -55% |
| Test Files | 15 | 30 | +100% |
| Parallel Speedup | 1x | 4.96x | 396% |
| Agents | 0 | 19 | ∞ |

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### 1. Python SDP Deprecated

**Before:** Python-based CLI tool
```bash
pip install spec-driven-protocol
sdp create-workstream --id WS-001-01
```

**After:** Go binary + agent orchestration
```bash
go install github.com/fall-out-bug/sdp@latest
@feature "Add authentication"  # Agent-guided planning
@oneshot F01                    # Autonomous execution
```

**Migration:** See `docs/migrations/multi-agent-migration.md`

### 2. Two-Stage Review Enforced

**Impact:** Workstreams must pass:
1. Implementer agent (TDD discipline)
2. Spec compliance reviewer (DO NOT TRUST)
3. Quality reviewer (multi-domain)

**Blockers:** Max 2 retries per stage before blocking

### 3. Agent Catalog Replaces Simple Skills

**Before:** Direct skill invocation
```bash
@build WS-001-01
```

**After:** Agent-coordinated execution
```bash
@build WS-001-01  # Internally spawns implementer → reviewer
```

## 📦 Installation

### Via Go Binary
```bash
# Install Go 1.25.6+
go install github.com/fall-out-bug/sdp@latest

# Verify
sdp status
```

### From Source
```bash

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Deferred to Future Releases
1. **Claude Plugin Marketplace** - Platform not yet available
2. **Zero runtime dependency** - Go binary required (original vision: prompts-only)
3. **OpenTelemetry integration** - Planned for Q2 2026
4. **Minor/medium conflict detection** - Defaults to major (TODO in synthesizer.go)

### Workaround for Plugin Distribution
Use Go binary installation until marketplace launches:
```bash
go install github.com/fall-out-bug/sdp@latest
```
